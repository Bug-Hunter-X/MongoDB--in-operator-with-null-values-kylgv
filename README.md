# MongoDB $in operator with null values

This repository demonstrates a common error when using the `$in` operator in MongoDB queries with arrays containing `null` values. The `$in` operator behaves unexpectedly in this scenario, potentially returning incorrect results.

## Bug Description

The issue occurs when you use the `$in` operator to query for documents where a field's value is present in an array that includes `null`. MongoDB will match documents where the field is `null`, which may not be the desired behavior.

## Solution

To avoid this issue, it is crucial to handle `null` values explicitly within your query.  One common strategy is to use the `$or` operator with `$ne` (not equal) or  to explicitly filter out `null` values.
